# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

In this notebook, I apply a number of Machine Learning methods to predict wether customers that already have a health insurance are also interested in taking a car insurance. I am using the dataset hosted at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction. 


Usage:

1. Create a new Python environment
2. In that environment, run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. In that environment, open the notebook
